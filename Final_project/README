Excuse the messiness in here, my ideas were kinda...
Anyway, just keeping it here so in case my dear 9-year-old Dell laptop trips and falls then end up deleted all important files (again)

Here are some of the hard milestones I should consider in this little game. I'm thinking about anime music for fellow weebs like me to vibe with:
**The welcome opening(make this last):
**The game on(make this first):
- 4 Karels will be animated vertically towards y—until it reaches the static Karel. 
- Print Value”” everytime player hit the key.
- A variable to count 4 different values:
	+Exellent: Where dynamic Karel will reach right on static Karel
	+Good: Around +-5 pixels around Karel
	+Almost there: Around +- 10 px to static Karel
	+Miss: y of dynamic Karel + 20 px and upto more > y of static Karel
Milestone:
[1].	Appear background
[2].	Appear 4 static Karel
[3].	Make random 1 Karel move vertically (create a list where it exists the 4 x and 4y of the static Karels)
[4].	Handle key press, if key was pressed, that moving Karel will disappear. (Condition: if the moving karel surpass the static one/ if one button was pressed)
a.	There are these possibilites:
-	Press the right button: E/G/A
-	Press the wrong button: M
-	Don’t press: M
[5].	Score count system. Appear the score on screen(Condition: if the moving karel surpass the static one/ if one button was pressed)
**The end goodbye(make this second):
-	4 values counted will be shown onto the screen as texts:
+”The audition has finished”
+”Here’s your result:”

-	Print a string of personality based result:
+ Consists of all 4 values and Ex >= 3: You’re making progress here my friend, you have tried so hard! Karel is proud of you <3
+ Consists of Ex: A pro gamer fr, no cap <3
+Doesn’t consist Miss: You’re doing as best as you can now my friend, respect <3
+Else: You’ve been trying your best and Karel knows that <3
**The background music: 
- The first one was at the beginning of the song where the welcome screen will be shown.(Some piano theme of an opening)
- The second one was a rock theme for when the game was being played.
- The third one was for the ending theme where the player's results will be shown on the screen.
