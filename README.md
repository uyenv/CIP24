# CIP24
I upload some of my code onto this place in order to store some valuable resources/ or some of the exercises that would be helpful to look back on. 

Those would include:
- Karel
- Console 
- Graphics
- The animation submodule in the 7th week will be added as ani.name_of_the_project.py.These mini projects would be in the main branch since they conclude the whole three topics 


(most) of my personal preference:
""" will be used to explain a chunk of code

"#" will be used to set a milestone or also a piece of code (if it was just for a smol line in one use)

I hope it sounds clear enough lmao
