# CIP24
I upload some of my code onto this place in order to store some valuable resources/ or some of the exercises that would be helpful to look back on. 

Those would include:
- Karel
- Console 
- Graphics
  
The animation submodule in the 7th week would be added as ani.name_of_the_project.py
These mini projects would be in the main branch since they conclude the whole three topics
